    Hello, my name is Diana. I am 25 years old and I am from Nablus.
     I graduated from An-Najah University, Department of Computer Science, 
     Class of 117. I am currently a software developer. I have a desire to learn front end 
     to gain more experience. This is what encouraged me to register and I hope I will do well in it.
